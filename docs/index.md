# Overview

phpSmug is a PHP wrapper class for the [SmugMug API](https://api.smugmug.com/api/v2/doc/index.html). The intention of this class is to allow PHP application developers to quickly and easily interact with the SmugMug API in their applications, without having to worry about the finer details of the API.

Not already a SmugMug user? Here, have a $5 discount off your first year on me by [registering](https://secure.smugmug.com/signup.mg?Coupon=2ZxFXMC19qOxU) using this code: **[2ZxFXMC19qOxU](https://secure.smugmug.com/signup.mg?Coupon=2ZxFXMC19qOxU)**

The development of phpSmug takes place in my free time. If you find phpSmug useful and found it has saved you a lot of time, I’d really appreciate it if you bought me a coffee or two.
